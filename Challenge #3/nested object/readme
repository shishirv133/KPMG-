This script defines a get_nested_value function that takes the object and key path as arguments and returns the corresponding value. 
It splits the key path into an array, and then iterates through the keys to access the value in the nested object.

You can use this function to extract values from nested objects by passing the object and key as arguments

# Example usage:
object='{"a":{"b":{"c":"d"}}}'
key="a/b/c"
value=$(get_nested_value "$object" "$key")
echo "Value : $value"

this will give value: a
